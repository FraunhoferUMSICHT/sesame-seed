# sesame-seed

This repository contains the results of the project Sesame Seed - Fundamentals, Design, and Implementation of Open Source Energy Storage Models. [FKZ: 03EI1021A](https://www.enargus.de/pub/bscw.cgi/?op=enargus.eps2&q=%2201205448%22&v=10&id=1371576).

The project took place within the [IEA Taks 32 - Modelling of Energy Storage for Simulation Optimization of Energy Systems](https://iea-es.org/task-32/).

In Sesame Seed a toolchain to consistently parametrize energy storage systems has been developed and tested for the use cases pumped hydro energy system and compressed air energy system. The toolchain is shown using Jupyter Notebooks, for easy understanding and applicability. The storage models are implemented using [oemof.solph](https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph).

**The code will follow soon. For first impressions visit [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/3/1525).**
